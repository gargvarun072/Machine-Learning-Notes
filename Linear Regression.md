**Linear Regression** is a machine learning algorithm based on **supervised learning**. It is also called a **linear model**. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.

Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.

While training the model we are given :  
**x:** input training data (univariate – one input variable(parameter))  
**y:** labels to data (supervised learning)

When training the model – it fits the best line to predict the value of y for a given value of x. The model gets the best regression fit line by finding the best m and x values.  
**m:** intercept  
**c:** coefficient of x
